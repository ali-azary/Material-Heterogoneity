# Material-Heterogoneity
modeling material heterogeneity with size effects using spatially-correlated weibull distribution
the python script generates a grid of random values from weibul distribution using inverse transform method. m is the heterogeneity index. Larger values of $m$ results in less variation, and as it approaches infinity, the material becomes homogeneous. The spatial correlation length factor $\theta$
